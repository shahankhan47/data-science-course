In the lecture on Generative AI for Querying Databases, you learned how to extract insights from large datasets using generative AI tools. Key points include:

    Querying Databases: Involves retrieving or manipulating data stored in an organized collection (database) using SQL (Structured Query Language).

    Generative AI's Role: It allows users to query databases using natural language, simplifying data access and understanding.
    
    SQL Commands: Examples of SQL queries include counting rows, calculating averages, filtering data, updating values, and sorting tables.

    Practical Application: The demo showcased how to use generative AI to generate SQL queries quickly, saving time compared to traditional methods.
