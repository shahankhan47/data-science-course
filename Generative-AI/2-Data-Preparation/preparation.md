Key Challenges in Data Preparation and Querying:
    Missing Values:
        Missing data can significantly hinder data analysis.
        Traditional methods like mean or median imputation often fail to capture the underlying data distribution.

    Outliers:
        Outliers can distort statistical analysis and lead to incorrect conclusions.
        Identifying these outliers is crucial for accurate data interpretation.

    Noise:
        Noise refers to unwanted random fluctuations in data that obscure meaningful patterns.
        Reducing noise is essential for effective data analysis.

    Data Translation:
        Converting data from one format to another is vital for data exchange.
        Inaccurate translations can lead to erroneous predictions.

    Natural Language Querying:
        Users often prefer to interact with data using natural language rather than complex SQL queries.
        This requires models that can understand and translate natural language into executable queries.

Generative AI Models and Their Applications:
    Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):
        Used for imputing missing values by learning patterns in the data and generating plausible values.

    Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):
        Effective for outlier detection by learning the boundaries of standard data distributions through a competitive process between a generator and a discriminator.

    Autoencoders:
        Excellent for noise reduction by capturing essential features of the data while discarding noise.

    Neural Machine Translation (NMT):
        Utilizes recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for accurate data translation tasks, including text-to-speech and image-to-text translations.

    Large Language Models (LLMs):
        Act as intermediaries for natural language querying, interpreting user intent and translating it into SQL statements.

    Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):
        Used for query recommendations by modeling the sequential nature of user queries, predicting the next logical query based on past interactions.

    Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):
        Demonstrate capabilities in query optimization by representing data as a graph, allowing for efficient query execution plans.

In the lecture, two generative AI tools were highlighted for data preparation:

ChatCSV:
    Functionality: Acts as a personal data analyst assistant. You can attach a CSV file and ask questions about the data.
    Key Features:
        Replaces missing values (e.g., using the mean).
        Identifies outliers through visualizations like box plots.
Tomat.AI:
    Functionality: A web-based platform that allows for data exploration and analysis.
    Key Features:
        Uploads and analyzes CSV files without limitations.
        Provides statistics for each column and allows grouping and filtering of data.
        Supports merging multiple data tables using joins and applying filters to refine data.
These tools enhance the efficiency of data preparation tasks, making it easier for data professionals to manage and analyze their datasets.
