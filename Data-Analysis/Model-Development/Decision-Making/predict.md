Model Validation: Ensure that model results make sense through visualization and numerical measures.

Example of Prediction: A car's price is predicted based on its highway miles per gallon (MPG). For an MPG of 30, the predicted price is $13,771.30, which is reasonable.

Coefficients: The coefficient indicates that for each unit increase in MPG, the car's price decreases by approximately $821.

Model Limitations: If predictions yield unrealistic values (e.g., negative prices), it may indicate issues with the model or data.

Visualization Techniques: Use regression plots and residual plots to assess model performance and identify non-linear behavior.

Mean Square Error (MSE): A key metric for evaluating model accuracy; lower MSE indicates a better fit.

RÂ² Value: Another evaluation method; values closer to 1 indicate a better fit, but acceptable values vary by field.
