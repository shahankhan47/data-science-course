A model can be thought of as a mathematical equation used to predict a value given one or more values.
Relating one or more independent variables to dependent variables.

Linear Regression:
Refers to 1 independent variable to make a prediction

Multiple Linear Regression
Refers to multiple independent variable to make a prediction

Simple Linear Regression:
Independent variable x, dependent variable y. y = mx + c

Noise:
Not all points in the graph will make a straight line for the model to make a prediction. There can be some points above or below the line which is called noise. Due to this, it's possible that our model may not make predictions accurately. See noise.png.
