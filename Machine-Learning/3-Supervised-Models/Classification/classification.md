Classification Method: A supervised learning technique that predicts labels for new data using trained models. The labels are categorical variables with discrete values.

Applications: Classification is used in various industries for tasks like email filtering, speech recognition, customer churn prediction, and loan default prediction.

Algorithms: Common classification algorithms include Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.

Multi-Class Predictions: Strategies like one-versus-all and one-versus-one classification are discussed for handling multiple classes.

Here's a brief comparison of one-vs-all and one-vs-one classification strategies:

One-vs-All Classification
    Approach: Each class is treated as a separate binary classification problem. A classifier is trained for each class to distinguish it from all other classes.
    Example: If there are three classes (A, B, C), three classifiers are created:
        Classifier 1: A vs. not A
        Classifier 2: B vs. not B
    Classifier 3: C vs. not C
    Prediction: For a new data point, each classifier makes a prediction, and the class with the highest confidence (or score) is selected.

One-vs-One Classification
    Approach: A classifier is trained for every possible pair of classes. This results in a larger number of classifiers compared to one-vs-all.
    Example: For three classes (A, B, C), three classifiers are created:
        Classifier 1: A vs. B
        Classifier 2: A vs. C
        Classifier 3: B vs. C
    Prediction: Each classifier votes for a class, and the class with the most votes is selected as the final prediction.

Key Differences
    Number of Classifiers: One-vs-all requires k classifiers (where k is the number of classes), while one-vs-one requires k(k-1)/2 classifiers.
    Complexity: One-vs-one can be more computationally intensive due to the larger number of classifiers but may yield better performance in some cases.
