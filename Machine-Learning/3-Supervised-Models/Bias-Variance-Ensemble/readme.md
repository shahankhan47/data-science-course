Bias and Variance: 
    Bias measures how far off predictions are from actual values, with low bias indicating high accuracy.
    Variance measures the spread of predictions across different training datasets, with high variance indicating sensitivity to training data.

Bias-Variance Tradeoff: 
    As model complexity increases, bias decreases while variance increases. Low complexity leads to high bias (underfitting), and high complexity leads to high variance (overfitting).

Weak and Strong Learners: 
    Weak learners have high bias and low variance, while strong learners have low bias and high variance.

Ensemble Methods:
    Bagging (e.g., Random Forests) reduces variance by averaging predictions from multiple models trained on bootstrapped datasets.
    Boosting builds a series of weak learners that correct errors from previous models, reducing bias.

======================================================================================================================================
Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve prediction accuracy and robustness. Here are two common ensemble techniques you can apply in practice:

Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating):
    How it works: Multiple models (often decision trees) are trained on different subsets of the training data, created by bootstrapping (sampling with replacement). The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions (for regression) or taking a majority vote (for classification).
    Example: Random Forest is a popular bagging method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to reduce variance and improve accuracy.

Boosting:
    How it works: Models are trained sequentially, where each new model focuses on correcting the errors made by the previous ones. The final prediction is a weighted sum of all models.
    Example: AdaBoost adjusts the weights of misclassified instances, allowing subsequent models to focus more on difficult cases, which helps reduce bias.

Weak and Strong Learners are concepts in machine learning that describe the performance of models based on their bias and variance characteristics:

Weak Learners:
    These are models that perform slightly better than random guessing.
    They typically have high bias and low variance, meaning they make strong assumptions about the data and may not capture the underlying patterns well.
    Weak learners often lead to underfitting, where the model is too simple to accurately represent the data.
    Example: A decision stump (a one-level decision tree) is a common weak learner.

Strong Learners:
    These models perform significantly better than random guessing and can capture complex patterns in the data.
    They usually have low bias and high variance, meaning they can fit the training data well but may become sensitive to noise, leading to overfitting.
    Strong learners are capable of generalizing better to unseen data when properly tuned.
    Example: A deep decision tree or a complex neural network can be considered strong learners.

======================================================================================================================================
Decision trees help mitigate bias and variance through their structure and the way they can be adjusted. Hereâ€™s how:

Bias Mitigation:
    Decision trees can model complex relationships in data, which helps reduce bias. By allowing the model to split data based on various features, they can capture intricate patterns that simpler models might miss.
    When decision trees are shallow (i.e., have limited depth), they may exhibit high bias, leading to underfitting. However, increasing the depth allows the model to learn more from the data, thus reducing bias.

Variance Mitigation:
    Decision trees are prone to high variance, especially when they are deep, as they can fit noise in the training data (overfitting). To mitigate this, techniques like pruning can be applied, which involves removing branches that have little importance, thus simplifying the model.
    Ensemble methods like bagging (e.g., Random Forests) use multiple decision trees trained on different subsets of the data. By averaging the predictions of these trees, variance is reduced, leading to more stable and reliable predictions.
