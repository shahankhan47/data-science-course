Challenges: Unsupervised learning lacks predefined labels, making evaluation subjective and requiring careful assessment of model quality.

Evaluation Methods:

    Heuristics: Different types of heuristics are used to evaluate cluster quality, including internal and external metrics.

    Internal Metrics: Assess clustering quality based on input data, such as:
        Silhouette Score: Measures cohesion within clusters versus separation from others.
        Davies-Bouldin Index: Evaluates the ratio of cluster compactness to separation.
        Inertia: Sum of variances within clusters in k-means clustering.

    External Metrics: Use ground truth labels to evaluate clustering quality, including:
        Adjusted Rand Index: Measures similarity between true labels and clustering outcomes.
        Normalized Mutual Information: Quantifies shared information between predicted clusters and true labels.
        Fowlkes-Mallows Index: Combines precision and recall based on clustering and label assignments.

    Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques like PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP are evaluated based on how well they retain important information, using metrics like explained variance ratio and reconstruction error.

    Visualization: Tools like scatter plots and dendrograms are essential for interpreting unsupervised learning results.
