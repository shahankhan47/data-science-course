In the lecture on Regression Metrics and Evaluation Techniques, you learned about the importance of evaluating regression models to determine their accuracy in predicting continuous numerical values. Key points include:

Error Measurement: The error of a model is the difference between predicted values and actual values.

Essential Metrics:
    MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Average absolute difference between predicted and observed values.
    MSE (Mean Squared Error): Sum of squared differences between predicted and observed values, divided by the number of data points minus the number of parameters.
    RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Square root of MSE, easier to interpret as it shares the same units as the target variable.
    R-squared: Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable, ranging from 0 (poor fit) to 1 (perfect fit).

Visual Evaluation: It's important to visualize results by plotting actual vs. predicted values to assess model fit.

Explained Variance: Indicates how much of the total variance in the target variable is explained by the model.
