Definition of Regression: A supervised learning model that predicts a continuous target variable based on explanatory features.

Types of Regression:
    Simple Regression: Involves one independent variable predicting a dependent variable (can be linear or nonlinear).
    Multiple Regression: Involves multiple independent variables predicting a dependent variable (also can be linear or nonlinear).

Applications of Regression:
    Sales forecasting, predicting house prices, maintenance predictions, estimating rainfall, and public health predictions.

Regression Algorithms: Includes classical methods like linear and polynomial regression, as well as modern methods like random forest, neural networks, Support vector machines (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting and K-nearest neighbour.
