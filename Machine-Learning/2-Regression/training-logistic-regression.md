Objective: The goal is to predict classes with minimal error by finding the best parameters (theta) that map input features to target outcomes.

Training Process:
    Start with an initial set of parameters (theta).
    Predict probabilities for each observation.
    Measure the prediction error using a cost function called log loss.
    Adjust theta to reduce this error and repeat until the log loss is minimized or a maximum number of iterations is reached.

Log Loss: This cost function measures how well predicted probabilities match actual classes, favoring confident correct classifications and penalizing confident incorrect ones.

Gradient Descent: An iterative method used to minimize the cost function by adjusting parameters in the direction of the steepest descent. The learning rate controls the step size.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): A faster variation that uses a random subset of data, which can lead to quicker convergence but may be less accurate.

=====================================================================================================================================
Gradient descent optimizes parameters in logistic regression through the following steps:

Initialization: Start with an initial set of parameters (theta), which can be chosen randomly.

Prediction: For each observation in the dataset, use the current parameters to predict the probability that the class is 1.

Cost Function Calculation: Calculate the cost function (log loss) to measure the error between the predicted probabilities and the actual classes.

Gradient Calculation: Compute the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters. The gradient indicates the direction and rate of change of the cost function.

Parameter Update: Adjust the parameters in the direction of the steepest descent (opposite to the gradient) using the formula:
    [
    \theta = \theta - \alpha \cdot \nabla J(\theta)
    ]
    where:
        (\theta) is the parameter vector,
        (\alpha) is the learning rate (controls the step size),
        (\nabla J(\theta)) is the gradient of the cost function.

Iteration: Repeat the prediction, cost function calculation, gradient calculation, and parameter update steps until the cost function converges to a minimum value or a specified number of iterations is reached.

=====================================================================================================================================
The learning rate plays a crucial role in gradient descent by controlling the size of the steps taken towards the minimum of the cost function. Here are the key points regarding its role:

Step Size: The learning rate ((\alpha)) determines how much the parameters (theta) are updated during each iteration. A larger learning rate results in larger updates, while a smaller learning rate leads to smaller updates.

Convergence Speed: 
    A high learning rate can speed up convergence initially, but it may overshoot the minimum, causing the algorithm to diverge or oscillate around the minimum without settling.
    A low learning rate ensures more precise updates, but it can slow down the convergence process, requiring more iterations to reach the minimum.
    
Balance: Finding the right learning rate is essential for effective optimization. If it's too high, the model may fail to converge; if it's too low, the training process may take too long.

Adaptive Learning Rates: Some advanced techniques adjust the learning rate dynamically during training to improve convergence, such as reducing the learning rate as the algorithm approaches the minimum.
