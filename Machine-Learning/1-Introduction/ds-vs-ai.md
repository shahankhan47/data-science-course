Roles:
    Data Scientists: Act as data storytellers, using mathematical models to analyze and derive insights from structured data. They focus on descriptive and predictive analytics.
    AI Engineers: Function as AI system builders, utilizing foundation models to create generative AI systems that transform business processes. They work with unstructured data.

Use Cases:
    Data scientists primarily engage in descriptive and predictive use cases, such as exploratory data analysis and regression models.
    AI engineers focus on prescriptive use cases, like decision optimization and recommendation engines.

Data Types:
    Data scientists often work with structured data (e.g., tables), while AI engineers handle unstructured data (e.g., text, images).

Models:
    Data scientists use a variety of traditional machine learning models, which are generally smaller and require less computational power.
    AI engineers primarily use foundation models, which are larger, more complex, and capable of generalizing across tasks.

Processes:
    The data science process involves selecting data, training models, and deploying them.
    The AI engineering process often starts with pre-trained models, leveraging prompt engineering to interact with these models.
