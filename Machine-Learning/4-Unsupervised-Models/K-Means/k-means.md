In the lecture on K-Means Clustering, you learned about the following key points:

Definition: K-Means is an iterative, centroid-based clustering algorithm that partitions a dataset into k non-overlapping clusters based on the distance between their centroids.

Centroid: The centroid is the average position of all points in a cluster, and data points nearest to a centroid are grouped together.
Choosing k: The value of k (number of clusters) affects the size and detail of the clusters; a higher k results in smaller, more detailed clusters.

Algorithm Steps:
    Initialize: Choose k and randomly select initial centroids.
    Assign Centroids: Compute distances and assign points to the nearest centroid.
    Update Centroids: Recalculate centroids as the mean of assigned points.
    Repeat until centroids stabilize or maximum iterations are reached.

Performance: K-Means can struggle with imbalanced clusters and assumes clusters are convex and of similar size.

Evaluation Techniques: Methods like silhouette analysis, the elbow method, and the Davies-Bouldin index help determine the best value for k.

========================================================================================================================================
Several factors influence the choice of k (the number of clusters) in K-Means Clustering:

Data Characteristics:
    Distribution: The natural grouping of data points can suggest an appropriate k. Visualizing data can help identify separable clusters.
    Dimensionality: Higher-dimensional data may require more clusters to capture the complexity of the data.

Cluster Size and Shape:
    K-Means assumes clusters are convex and of similar size. If the actual clusters differ significantly in size or shape, it may affect the choice of k.

Performance Evaluation Techniques:
    Silhouette Analysis: Measures how similar a data point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters, helping to assess the appropriateness of k.
    Elbow Method: Involves plotting the K-Means objective function against different values of k and looking for a "knee" point where the rate of decrease sharply changes.
    Davies-Bouldin Index: Evaluates the average similarity ratio of each cluster with the most similar cluster, providing insight into the optimal k.

Domain Knowledge:
    Understanding the specific context or domain of the data can guide the selection of k based on expected groupings.
