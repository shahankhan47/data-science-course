In the lecture on DBSCAN and HDBSCAN Clustering, you learned about two density-based clustering algorithms:

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):
    It identifies clusters based on a user-defined density value.
    Points are classified as core points (with enough neighbors), border points (near core points but not dense enough), or noise points (isolated).
    It can discover clusters of various shapes and sizes and effectively handles noise and outliers.
    The algorithm is not iterative; it labels points in one pass.

HDBSCAN (Hierarchical DBSCAN):
    A variant of DBSCAN that does not require parameter tuning.
    It uses cluster stability to adaptively adjust neighborhood sizes, resulting in more meaningful clusters.
    It constructs a hierarchical tree of clusters and simplifies it to retain only the most stable clusters.
    Both algorithms are useful for clustering data with complex patterns and noise, with HDBSCAN offering more flexibility and robustness compared to DBSCAN.

========================================================================================================================================
The main differences between DBSCAN and HDBSCAN are:

Parameter Sensitivity:
    DBSCAN requires the user to set parameters for the minimum number of points in a neighborhood and the radius (epsilon). This can affect the clustering results significantly.
    HDBSCAN does not require these parameters to be set explicitly, making it more flexible and user-friendly.

Cluster Stability:
    DBSCAN identifies clusters based on a fixed density threshold, which can lead to less stable clusters in varying density regions.
    HDBSCAN uses cluster stability, which measures how persistent a cluster is across different density thresholds, resulting in more robust and meaningful clusters.

Output:
    DBSCAN produces a flat clustering result, labeling points as part of a cluster or noise.
    HDBSCAN generates a hierarchical structure of clusters, allowing for a more detailed understanding of the data's structure.
