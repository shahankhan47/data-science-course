Seaborn is a data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, designed to create visually appealing statistical graphics with less code.
It offers built-in themes and color palettes, making plots more attractive with minimal effort.
Seaborn integrates well with libraries like NumPy and SciPy, allowing for easy combination of statistical analysis and visualizations.
It provides specialized plot types, such as regression plots, which can be created with a single line of code using the regplot function.
You can customize plots by changing colors and marker shapes.
Seaborn also allows for plotting categorical data, such as using the countplot function to visualize counts of records for different categories.
