- Line plots:
    - Displays data as series of data points connected by straight lines.
    - Display trends over time
    - Compare datasets with a continuous independent variable like age/time/etc
    - Illustrate cause and effect relationships
    - Visualize continuous data
    - Can be misleading if the scales on the axes are not carefully chosen.

- Bar plot:
    - Displays data using rectangualar bars.
    - Height/length of the bar represents magnitude of the data.
    - Can be either vertical or horizontal.
    - Compare different categories or groups.
    - Displays discrete data that has distinct categories.
    - Show how different categories contribute to the whole.
    - Visualize data that can be easily ranked or ordered.
    - Can be misleading if the scales on the axes are not carefully chosen.

- Scatter plot:
    - Uses cartesian coordinates to display values for 2 variables.
    - Value of one variable -> x-axis position. Value of another variable -> y-axis position.
    - Used for:
        - Examining relationship between 2 continuous variables.
        - Investigating patterns or trends in data.
        - Detect outliers or unusual observations.
        - Identify clusters or groups within the data.
        - Exploring complex data.

- Box plot:
    - Displays distribution of dataset along with key statistical measures.
    - Represents the interquartile range as a box, a median line and whiskers indicating range.
    - Outliers are represented as individual data points beyond whiskers.
    - Used for:
        - Compare distribution of a continuous variable accross different categories or groups.
        - Examine spread and skewness of dataset
        - Visualizin quartiles.
        - Identify and analyze potential outliers.
        - Visualize summary statistics.
        - Compare distribution of multiple variables in a dataset side by side.
        
- Histogram:
    - Graphical representation of dataset distribution.
    - Shows frequency or relative frequency within intervals.
    - Bars represent the data count in each interval.
    - Used for:
        - Understand data distribution
        - Visually depict the shape of the data
        - Assess skewness in the data
        - Showcase data variability and spread
