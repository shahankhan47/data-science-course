Dash is an open-source Python library for creating reactive web-based applications.
It combines Flask for web servers and React.js for rendering components.
Dash applications are mobile and cross-platform-ready.
There are two main components in Dash:
    Core Components (imported as DCC): These include interactive elements like sliders and date pickers.
    HTML Components (imported as HTML): These correspond to HTML tags and allow you to structure your layout using Python.
You can create applications by defining a layout and adding interactivity.
